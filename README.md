# Icchapurti Hanuman Temple - Static Website

This is a simple static website for Icchapurti Hanuman Temple. It is meant to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Files to add
- `index.html`  (provided)
- `/images/logo.png`           → temple logo (replace with your logo)
- `/images/qr.jpg`             → QR code image (for donations)
- `/images/temple-entrance.jpg`
- `/images/temple-outside.jpg`
- `/images/hanuman.jpg`
- `/images/temple-works.jpg`

**Important:** Rename your photos to the names above and place them in `images/`.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g. `icchapurti-hanuman-temple`).
2. Add `index.html`, `README.md`, and the `images/` folder and push to `main` branch.
3. In repository settings → Pages, set Source to **main branch** and folder `/ (root)` and save.
4. After a minute the site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Edit content
Open `index.html` and edit text, timings, contact info or amounts as needed.

## Help
If you want, I can:
- generate a simple donation form or template for a bank details page,
- produce a `CNAME` if you want to use a custom domain,
- or convert this into a small multi-page site (About / Donate / Gallery) — tell me which you prefer.
